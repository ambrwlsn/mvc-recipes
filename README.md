## Installation

Once you have cloned or downloaded the repository code:

```sh
cd mvc-recipes
```

Then open `index.html` in a browser

## Purpose

Learning the MVC paradigm by building a simple app!

- **Model** - manages the data of an application
- **View** - a visual representation of the model
- **Controller** - links the user and the system

I wrote this application using `index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`, and a few favicons. This means that I could learn the pure model-view-controller paradigm from scratch, and without the addition of a framework.
